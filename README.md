==============

Standalone estatsd server


Building
--------------

Get [rebar](https://github.com/basho/rebar) (may be included in package for future releases). From a command line, execute:

````bash
/path/to/rebar get-deps clean compile generate
````

This will generate a folder in the release directory called 'estatsd'. At this point you can use make_deb.sh to build a debian package for service installation, or you can simply copy the newly created directory to your target system.

Running
--------------

### Deployed Directory

If you simply copied the directory to your target system:

````bash
/path/to/estatsd/bin/estatsd start
````

### Installed as Service

If installed using a debian generated by make_deb.sh, many linux systems will support:

````bash
service estatsd start
````
If your system does not support 'service', you can use the init.d script directly:

````bash
/etc/init.d/estatsd start
